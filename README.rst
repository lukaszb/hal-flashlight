Hal Flashlight
==============

Extremely simple flashlight application.

- Light lock/unlock mechanism
- Retina ready
- Simple!

Motivation
----------

Author wanted to submit his first iOS app to the App Store. Why yet another
flashlight app? Well, this one is and always will be free (and open source) and
has *locking* mechanism, small thing that is sometimes missing at other flashlight
apps. It's also ads-free.

Development
-----------

Codes are at github: https://github.com/lukaszb/hal-flashlight. If you spot
a bug, please file issue at https://github.com/lukaszb/hal-flashlight/issues.

Graphics
~~~~~~~~

Hal-like button was made in Pixelmator_ based on excellent tutorial_. Lock icon
was taken from Glyphish_.

Sounds
~~~~~~

All the sounds were taken from http://www.freesound.org/ (one of the samples
was cut with Audacity_).
